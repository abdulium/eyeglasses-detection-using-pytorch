# Eyeglasses detection using PyTorch

## Abstract
This exercise was done as a part of job recruitment requirement. The ultimate goal is how to deal with imbalanced data using PyTorch. Two approaches were used to deal with said problem, weighted random sampler, and focal loss


## Problem
We are trying to identify people with eyeglasses and without. Using [CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) which is imbalanced for our two classes. In this project, we will incorporate methods to deal with such imbalanced image data.



## Data and models
Dataset is created by [Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/) and [Ping Lui](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~pluo/) and can be found [here](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). We will be using ResNet34 and VGG16.
